<para text="The acronym CRLF stands for &quot;Carriage Return, Line Feed&quot; and refers to the sequence of characters used to denote the end of a line of text.  CRLF injection vulnerabilities occur when data enters an application from an untrusted source and is not properly validated before being used.  For example, if an attacker is able to inject a CRLF into a log file, he could append falsified log entries, thereby misleading administrators or cover traces of the attack.  If an attacker is able to inject CRLFs into an HTTP response header, he can use this ability to carry out other attacks such as cache poisoning.  CRLF vulnerabilities primarily affect data integrity.  "/>

<para text="Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed occur whenever a web application uses untrusted data in the output it generates without validating or encoding it.  XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise sensitive information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis.  XSS is also commonly referred to as HTML injection."/>
<para text="XSS vulnerabilities can be either persistent or transient (often referred to as stored and reflected, respectively).  In a persistent XSS vulnerability, the injected code is stored by the application, for example within a blog comment or message board.  The attack occurs whenever a victim views the page containing the malicious script.  In a transient XSS vulnerability, the injected code is included directly in the HTTP request.  These attacks are often carried out via malicious URLs sent via email or another website and requires the victim to browse to that link.  The consequence of an XSS attack to a victim is the same regardless of whether it is persistent or transient; however, persistent XSS vulnerabilities are likely to affect a greater number of victims due to its delivery mechanism."/>

The tainted data is directed into an output stream returned by javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.

Properly encode all untrusted data before using it to construct an HTTP response. The encoding method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity encoding (e.g. StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() in J2EE or HttpUtility.HtmlEncode() in ASP.NET). In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

<flaw severity="3" categoryname="Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)" count="1" issueid="144" module="WebGoat-5.0-with-jsp.war" type="javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.print" description="This call to javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.print() contains a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw. The application populates the HTTP response with user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to embed malicious content, such as Javascript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. XSS vulnerabilities are commonly exploited to steal or manipulate cookies, modify presentation of content, and compromise confidential information, with new attack vectors being discovered on a regular basis. The first argument to print() contains tainted data from the variable thisPage. The tainted data originated from earlier calls to javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getParameterNames, and javax.servlet.ServletRequest.getParameter. The tainted data is directed into an output stream returned by javax.servlet.jsp.JspWriter.

Properly encode all untrusted data before using it to construct an HTTP response. The encoding method should be chosen based on the specific use case of the untrusted data. For example, if the data is being written to the body of an HTML page, use HTML entity encoding (e.g. StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() in J2EE or HttpUtility.HtmlEncode() in ASP.NET). In addition, as a best practice, always validate user-supplied input to ensure that it conforms to the expected format, using centralized data validation routines when possible.

<para text="Applications commonly use cryptography to implement authentication mechanisms and to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data, both in transit and at rest.  The proper and accurate implementation of cryptography is extremely critical to its efficacy.  Configuration or coding mistakes as well as incorrect assumptions may negate a large degree of the protection it affords, leaving the crypto implementation vulnerable to attack."/>
<para text="Common cryptographic mistakes include, but are not limited to, selecting weak keys or weak cipher modes, unintentionally exposing sensitive cryptographic data, using predictable entropy sources, and mismanaging or hard-coding keys.  "/>
<para text="Developers often make the dangerous assumption that they can improve security by designing their own cryptographic algorithm; however, one of the basic tenets of cryptography is that any cipher whose effectiveness is reliant on the secrecy of the algorithm is fundamentally flawed.  "/>
</desc>
<recommendations>
<para text="Select the appropriate type of cryptography for the intended purpose.  Avoid proprietary encryption algorithms as they typically rely on &quot;security through obscurity&quot; rather than sound mathematics.  Select key sizes appropriate for the data being protected; for high assurance applications, 256-bit symmetric keys and 2048-bit asymmetric keys are sufficient.  Follow best practices for key storage, and ensure that plaintext data and key material are not inadvertently exposed."/>

Issuing a cookie without the Secure attribute allows the browser to transmit it over unencrypted connections, which are susceptible to eavesdropping.
